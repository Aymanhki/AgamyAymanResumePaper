	Re: Summer 2025 Student - Data Science Intern (8 months)
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	\noindent
	I am writing to express my strong interest in the Summer 2025 Data Science Intern position with RBC's Next Best
	Action (NBA) Machine Learning team. As a Computer Science student at the University of Manitoba graduating in April
	2025, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to RBC's mission of deepening client relationships through
	innovative data science solutions.
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	\noindent
	My academic background in Computer Science, combined with my practical experience in software development and data
	analysis, aligns well with the technical requirements of this role. Through my project work, particularly the
	Flights Analyzer project, I have demonstrated proficiency in handling large datasets and implementing complex data
	analysis solutions. This project involved processing a 50GB dataset of flight records and weather data, requiring
	strong programming skills in Python and SQL - key technical requirements for this position.
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	\noindent
	Your posting emphasizes the need for strong programming skills and experience with data transformation and
	visualization. During my time at Agriculture \&
	Agri-Food Canada, I developed full-stack applications that required precise data handling and visualization
	capabilities. I implemented multi-lingual features and complex calculations, showcasing my ability to translate
	business requirements into technical solutions - a skill that would be valuable in developing and enhancing NBA
	machine learning products.
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	\noindent
	What particularly excites me about this role is the opportunity to work with diverse data sources and
	domain-specific machine learning models in a corporate banking environment. My experience with various database
	technologies (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) positions me well to contribute to your
	team's migration of models to a Cloud environment. Additionally, my strong problem-solving abilities and
    passion for
	continuous learning, demonstrated through my role as a peer mentor where I earned Tutor of the Year, align
    perfectly
	with your team's innovative culture.
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	\noindent
	I am confident that my technical skills, collaborative nature, and genuine enthusiasm for data science make me an
	excellent candidate for this position. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to RBC's
	Next Best Action Machine Learning team.
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	\noindent
	Thank you for considering my application.
